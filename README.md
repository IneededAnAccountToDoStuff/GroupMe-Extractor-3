# GroupMe-Extractor-3
It's an extractor for GroupMe using the API. It properly grabs topics and attachments.

I got annoyed at the fact that GroupMe's export data does not grab the messages from subtopics. So I wrote my own. It's been a ~~long~~annoying journey. I started with the API, but could not get it to work. So I tried making an extractor bookmarklet. Eventaully, jumped back to the API. This has been years in the making*. (By that, I mean I've been trying for years. This code was started a few days ago.)

## Getting your API token.
Visit https://dev.groupme.com/

The source code asks you for your token every time. If you use this regularly, I'd recommend editing the .py file with your token.
